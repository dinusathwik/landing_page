          <h1>what is anime</h1>
          <p>
            anime is a japanese term for hand-drawn or computer animation. the
            word is the abbreviated pronunciation of "animation" in japanese,
            where this term references all animation. outside japan, anime is
            used to refer specifically to animation from japan or as a
            japanese-disseminated animation style often characterized by
            colorful graphics, vibrant characters and fantastical themes.
            culturally, anime is considered a form of art.
